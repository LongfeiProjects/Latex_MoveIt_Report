Torque feedback as it is now in MS5-6~Rev2c arms helps dampen vibration. Even though torque feedback does not suppress completely small vibration, it definitely helps to contain vibration within a certain range and reduce settling time. However, from the current stability analysis, torque open loop margins are negative for an important part of the workspace. No instability has been observed in operation, which means the controller, the two closed loops together, position and torque, is stable.

There is a couple of possible ameliorations that could be done on MS5-6~Rev2c arms. However, this work may not be reusable for MS7. The focus now is to progress on MS7 controller concept and ensure good methods will be implemented for tuning and stability analysis. Concept review should be presented soon for MS7, while actuators and the base are currently in design phase, to make sure that control requirements will be met in regards of the hardware and the firmware.
